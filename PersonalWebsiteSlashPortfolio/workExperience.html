      <h3>University Book and Supply</h3>
      <h4>Cashier - September 2022 to October 2023</h4>
      <p>I worked as cashier for University Book and Supply for 1 year. I started as cashier only and then moved to doing more and more odd jobs. I helped with clothing stock items on the floor and move boxes in storage. I helped textbooks by organizing the books on shelves and processing orders at the start of semesters. I also helped managers with other random jobs they had.</p>
