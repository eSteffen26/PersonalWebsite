      <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
      <p>This project is about this very website! I have started from scratch. All code and graphics were done by me. There is still a lot left to do on this site but I feel like it's at a good place to show it off.</p>

      <h3>UNI Cave Research</h3>
      <p>This project involved me going into caves and filming the research team as they do their work. As my media partner and I gathered footage we logged all clips in 2 spreadsheets. One sheet was created by me and organized the footage by many variables, from who is in the clip to what content is being covered. The other sheet was more a the industry standard footage log with descriptions on video and audio separate. After filming was done, I was talked to create 2 videos with the footage gathered over the summer. I am currently in the process of editing these 2 videos therefor I can not share much. I also used my Adobe Illustrator skills to create a graphic for my media partner's videos.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Went into caves to film researchers</li>
        <li>Logged hundreds of clips over the summer and fall</li>
        <li>Got assigned 2 video topics to create this fall</li>
        <li>Used Premier Pro to create said videos</li>
        <li>Used Adobe Illustrator to create a graphic for my media partner's videos</li>
        <li>Videos are not complete yet so I can not share</li>
      </ul>
